# OnLime - Group 2

### Local Area Network Office Messaging System 

Overview A sleek, office-based messaging system which will allow team members to exchange, store, delete, and organize messages. The system can operate peer-to-peer or via a centralized server, using the office’s LAN. It also includes group messaging and broadcasting capabilities.

- Identify all members of the messaging system
- Indicate the status of each member (ie. Offline or Connected)
- Ability of the user to set individual status (ie, online, away, busy, etc...)
- Provide a facility for the creation of short messages (you must decide on the feasible size)
- Display a pop-up message to the recipient upon arrival of a message
- Store all incoming messages in the message Inbox.
- Store copies of all sent messages
- Once read, messages can be retained or removed from the Inbox.
- Backup and restore capabilities #

# Future Features
- Sound notification option when a new message arrives
- More advanced status settings such as Online, Busy, Out to Lunch, On the Phone, Away from Desk
- Deferred messaging to offline users that will be delivered when the recipient comes online.
- Creation of groups to which users can be assigned to facilitate group messaging
- Office-wide message broadcasting that can be directed to all users or just users online.
- Out-of-Office return messages providing details such as “at meeting ABC until...”
- Long-term message archive where messages are removed from the primary storage to a secondary archive for long-term storage
- Categorization of messages based on Projects, Clients, or other Users.
